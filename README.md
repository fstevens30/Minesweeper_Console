# Minesweeper Board using arrays in JavaScript

**This is an asssessment done in SDV503 at NMIT 2022**

- The aim of the assessment is to create a JavaScript program that takes an input arrays of where bombs are on a minesweeper board and translate it to a board where each cells value is the number of neighboring mines.

**E.G**

Input -   
[  
[0,1,0,0]  
[0,0,1,0]  
[0,1,0,1]  
[1,1,0,0]  
]  

(0 represents an empty space, 1 represents a bomb)

Output -   
[  
[1,x,2,1]  
[2,3,x,2]  
[3,x,4,x]  
[x,x,3,1]  
]  

(x represents a mine, digits represent the number of adjacent mines)

- The task also requires a Design.MD document explaining the code.
